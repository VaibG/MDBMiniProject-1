# Meet The Members - MDB

## Description
Welcome to my version of Match the Members! An app created for the purposes of reviewing and remembering the member names of people currently in MDB. It displays the members of MDB for Fall 2018 and gives the user 5 seconds to identify a member based on a picture.

These are the features of my application:
* A score counter of the number of items that one has gotten correct
* A stop/start button for the game, a timer which ends after 5 seconds and triggers a completely new question
* The ability to start/stop the game by exiting or entering the Stats page
* The ability to Stop the timer on the Game page, go to the Stats page, and have the Timer still be paused
* A Stats Screen that displays:
  * Your longest streak of correct questions
  * Your last three results
