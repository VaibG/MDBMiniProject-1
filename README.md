Welcome to my version of Match the Members! An app created for the purposes of reviewing and remembering the member names of people currently in MDB. These are the specifications of my application:

A score counter of the number of items that one has gotten correct
A stop/start button for the game, a timer which ends after 5 seconds and triggers a completely new question
The ability to start/stop the game by exiting or entering the Stats page
The ability to Stop the timer on the Game page, go to the Stats page, and have the Timer still be paused
A Stats Screen that displays:
Your longest streak of correct questions
Your result
